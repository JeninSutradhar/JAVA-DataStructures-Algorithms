## Introduction

Understanding data structures and algorithms is essential for every software engineer and computer scientist. This repository aims to provide implementations of commonly used data structures and algorithms in a variety of programming languages, along with explanations and examples.

## Data Structures

The following data structures are implemented in this repository:

- Linked List
- Stack
- Queue
- Binary Tree
- Binary Search Tree
- Graph
- Hash Table
- Heap
- Trie
- ...

Each data structure is organized into its own directory and includes the implementation code, along with explanations and examples of usage.

## Algorithms

The following algorithms are implemented in this repository:

- Sorting Algorithms (Bubble Sort, Insertion Sort, Merge Sort, Quick Sort, etc.)
- Searching Algorithms (Linear Search, Binary Search, Depth-First Search, Breadth-First Search, etc.)
- Dynamic Programming Algorithms
- Graph Algorithms (Dijkstra's Algorithm, Prim's Algorithm, Kruskal's Algorithm, etc.)
- String Algorithms (String Matching, String Parsing, etc.)
- ...
(Add more algorithms as you implement them)

Similar to data structures, each algorithm is organized into its own directory and includes the implementation code, explanations, and examples.

## Contributing
